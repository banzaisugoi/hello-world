# hello-world

At December 31, 2017 I made a 'New Year resolution' that in 2018 I'll become a freelance software developer. In order to achieve this dare goal I started to learn Python and naturally came across GitHub as an industry standard for version control. My journey starts here!

Cheers!
Alex Stepanov
